# Project-Noted

Welcome to the Noted project readme! This repository serves as a hub for all the resources and links related to the project. In this document, you will find information about the project, its purpose, how it works, and the technology stack used. 

## Overview

Noted is a project that consists of a Chrome extension and a web dashboard. Its purpose is to make note-taking on YouTube more efficient by allowing users to take notes while watching videos without switching tabs. Users can categorize video notes into categories and update notes using the web dashboard.

## Repositories

The Noted project is divided into three repositories:

- Chrome Extension Repo: https://github.com/getNoted/Note-Ed-Chrome-Extension
- Web Dashboard Repo: https://github.com/getNoted/Note-ed-Dashboard
- Backend Repo: https://github.com/getNoted/Backend

## How it works

Noted works by recording timestamps while the user is watching a YouTube video. The Chrome extension allows users to easily bookmark a timestamp and write notes and important points without switching tabs. The notes are stored in a database and can be accessed and updated through the web dashboard.

Once the user logs in, the dashboard displays all the videos they have made notes for using Noted. The videos are clickable, allowing users to enter the note-making section or read their notes just by clicking on the respective video.

Noted uses the [Editorjs](https://editorjs.io/) to provide a rich text editor for note-taking. Debouncing is used to auto-save the data to the database.
